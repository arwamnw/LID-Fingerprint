* Gaussian noise

The performance of the algorithm degrades when it is common for points to have
equally good neighbors. An example is points from a regular grid in 2-D space;
the four immediate neighbors of each points are equally good.  In such case,
random Gaussian noise can be injected into the dataset to make an arbitrary
ranking of equally good neighbors.  The parameter "--noise" is used for this
purpose.  When the parameter "--noise v" presents, the standard deviation
"sigma" of the values in the dataset is computed, then a Gaussian noise with
standard deviation of "sigma * v" is added to each value.  If bad performance
is actually caused by this reason, a very small noise (1e-6) is sufficient to
make huge difference.  Note that the control is computed after noise injection,
so the performance should not be reported as the performance on the original
data.  Rather, it indicates that recall is not a fair measure for the original
data.
